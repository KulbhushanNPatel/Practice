          <h1>Dan Dan Noodles</h1>
          <p>2 tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns <br>
            1 inch-long piece of Chinese cinnamon (gui-pi) <br>
            2 star anise <br>
            1 cup oil <br>
            1/4 cup crushed red pepper flakes  <br>
            3 teaspoons oil <br>
            8 oz. ground pork <br>
            2 teaspoons sweet bean sauce<br>
            2 teaspoons shaoxing wine <br>
            1 teaspoon dark soy sauce <br>
            1/2 teaspoon five spice powder <br>
            1/3 cup sui mi ya cai<br>
            In a small pot, add the Sichuan peppercorns, cinnamon stick, star anise, and oil. Over medium low heat, slowly heat to 325 degrees Fahrenheit, and then turn off the heat. Wait 6-7 minutes, then remove the peppercorns, cinnamon stick, and star anise with a slotted spoon. <br>
            Add the crushed red pepper flakes and allow them to steep in the hot oil. It should start smelling fragrant, almost like popcorn. Allow the oil to cool. This makes more chili oil than you’ll need, but you’ll be glad to have it on hand for use in other dishes. Store in a glass jar and keep refrigerated. <br>
            In a wok, heat a teaspoon of oil over medium heat, and brown the ground pork. Add the sweet bean sauce, shaoxing wine, dark soy sauce, and five spice powder. Cook until all the liquid is evaporated. Set aside. Heat the other 2 teaspoons of oil in the wok over medium heat, and sautee the sui mi ya ci (pickled vegetables) for a few minutes. Set aside. 
            <br><br></p>

            <h2>The Sauce</h2>
            <p>
            2 tablespoons sesame paste (tahini) <br>
3 tablespoons soy sauce <br>
2 teaspoons sugar <br>
1/4 teaspoon five spice powder <br>
1/2 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorn powder (we ground whole Sichuan peppercorns in a mortar and pestle) <br>
1/2 cup of your prepared chili oil (scary, but yes!) <br>
2 cloves garlic, very finely minced <br>
¼ cup hot cooking water from the noodles <br>
Mix together all the ingredients. Taste and adjust seasoning if you like. You can loosen it with more hot water, add more Sichuan peppercorn powder, etc.

<br>

Cook the noodles according to package directions and drain. We used fresh noodles, but dry noodles are great too. I actually might prefer the dried, because they’re a bit less starchy. (Now would be the time to add some of the noodle cooking water to your sauce). Blanch the greens in the noodle water, and drain. To assemble, divide the sauce among six bowls (or four if you want larger servings)…
